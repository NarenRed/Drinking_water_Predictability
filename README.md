Access to save drinking water is important for public health. According to the world health organization can improved water supply and sanitation and better management of water resources boost the economic growth and contribute to poverty reduction.

**Potable water**, commonly known as drinking water, is obtained from surface and underground sources and is treated to fulfil state and federal drinking water requirements. Microorganisms, bacteria, harmful compounds, viruses, and faeces are all removed from natural water sources. Drinking untreated, raw water can lead to gastrointestinal issues like diarrhoea, vomiting, and fever.

## Factors affecting Water Potability is listed below.

1.	ph: pH of water (0 to 14).
2.	Hardness: Capacity of water to precipitate soap in mg/L.
3.	Solids: Total dissolved solids in ppm.
4.	Chloramines: Amount of Chloramines in ppm.
5.	Sulfate: Amount of Sulfates dissolved in mg/L.
6.	Conductivity: Electrical conductivity of water in μS/cm.
7.	Organic_carbon: Amount of organic carbon in ppm.
8.	Trihalomethanes: Amount of Trihalomethanes in μg/L.
9.	Turbidity: Measure of light emitting property of water in NTU.
10.	Potability: Indicates if water is safe for human consumption. Potable - 1 and 
Not potable – 0
